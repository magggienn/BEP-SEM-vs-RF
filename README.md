# BEP-SEM-vs-RF
Repository for adding my code for the Bachelor End Project
This is a line from Rstudio

I re-used the code from:

Supplementary material to the paper De Rooij, M., Karch, J.D., Fokkema, M., Bakk, Z., Citra Pratiwi, B., and Kelderman, H. (2022). SEM-based out-of-sample predictions. Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10705511.2022.2061494

In this repository there was:

1.the function predicty.lavaan for making out-of-sample predictions based on a lavaan object.
2.The Rmd and corresponding output pdf file for the analysis of the Political Democracy data
3.The pdf file showing the analysis on the CERQ-scale data.
4.The pdf file showing the analysis on the CERQ-item data.
5.Simstudy2.R: R code for the three simulation studies
