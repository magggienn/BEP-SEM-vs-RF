# BEP-SEM-vs-RF
Repository for adding my code for the Bachelor End Project in Data Science at Eindhoven University of Technology and 
Tilburg University

I re-used the simulation and prediction function - predicty.Lavaan code from:

-The paper of De Rooij, M., Karch, J.D., Fokkema, M., Bakk, Z., Citra Pratiwi, B., and Kelderman, H. (2022). 
SEM-based out-of-sample predictions. Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal.

In this repository there you can find the following folders with information in them:

1.Simulation Files:
    a)Tuned Random Forest R files and graphs
    b)Untuned Random Forest R files and graphs
2.Code 
    a)Predicty.Lavaan function developed by De Rooj et al.
    b)Simulation Study - R code with 3 simulation studies
